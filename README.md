- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan. I am a biochemist for a genomics company. I have an honors degree in Integrative Biology with a conentration in Genetics from Oregon State University.
- I'm experienced in molecular biology, enzymology, genomics, and NGS. I mostly use python, but I also work with R relatively frequently.
- I have been coding since a teenager, but not in any serious way until more recently, as I'm trying to break into bioinformatics more.
- I will mostly use this as a place to store and share my small pet projects.
- Reach out if you want to connect!
